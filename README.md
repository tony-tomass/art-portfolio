# My Art Portfolio Website

This is a website made to showcase the different art-related projects I made over the years. The purpose of this website is to provide myself with a better way to showcase my own works in a simple manner and in a way that would be easy to update frequently.
It mainly focuses on my digital art but will also showcase other projects related to things like video-editing, video game development, graphic design, etc. This website is similar to my other [website](https://github.com/tony-tomass/tony-tomass.github.io) 
project created several months prior for my web development class. Unlike that one, this website will be worked on during my own personal time with more emphasis on professionalism. 

All changes and notes made during development can be seen in the [Changelog](https://github.com/tony-tomass/art-portfolio/blob/main/changelog.txt) text file
